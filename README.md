# wordbubbles
Script which takes a wordbubbles board as input and tries to solve it.
Will only tell you the solution if it finds the whole thing, which is just dependent on whether or not the list of words contains the ones in the puzzle.
Prints it in a nice little format, which also tells you which letters on the grid are needed for each word.
